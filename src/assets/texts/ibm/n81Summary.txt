I spent 3 coop terms at N8Identity (4 months each) and worked as a Java developer on a web application called ELM. ELM was a product that aided large companies with onboarding their employees. We used Spring framework for ELM and primefaces for the user interface. The backend was many Java OSGI services that we ran on service mix and used Hiberate to communicate with the database. Some of my responsiblility here included: content management directly with clients, creating a client Software Specification Document for a reporting module in ELM, creating a feed handler for bulk data load, typical ELM enhancements and bug fixes.
