In September 2015, I started a new venture at IBM. I was given the responsibility of leading the development of ICM’s UI, a migration from windows to web app. After a successful rewrite of ICM’s UI, I was promoted to Lead UI Architect and moved onto rewriting the UI of another application called RCA. Once the Architect, not only was I responsible for building the initial UI build for the applications, I was also responsible for educating all teams in our office on coding good practices. After another successful rewrite of RCA’s UI, I now work on a common component library for all our products to use with the goal of saving effort and making them more consistent.
